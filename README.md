#Billme

Welcome to Billme. This website has been created for Billme a fintech business idea.

Billme is service that users sign up to consolidate all their bills, subscriptions, free trials etc by providing a billme email address for users to use at the sign up stage.
Users can then log in to the Billme website to manage all of these in one place.

WireFraming:
The wireframes were created using Balsamiq to produce low fidelity wireframes.

The structure of the site was based on landing pages/ click funnels. 
Alongside that I looked for best practise in landing page design with some examples being:
https://www.salesforce.com/eu/?ir=1
https://www.gong.io/
https://www.revolut.com/
https://justworks.com/

What all fintech or technology sites tend to have in common is: 
A strong headline
A short about us or product explainer section
A unique value proposition or features section
A customer testimonials or awards section
A sign up or email subscription section

The structure of the pages are center aliged through a wrapper or grid structure; with a margin left and right.
The sections all easily flow from one to next through great design and color schemes.
Adding revelent content and different media types to support the text based messaging.

The Wireframes 
With this research in mind the wireframes have both a desktop and mobile version showing the following sections:
Header/Navigation
Hero or Showcase
About Billme 
Features
Reasons Why
Sign Up 
Footer

Between mobile and Desktop I was able to make decisions as to how the content should be responsive to screensize and which solutions are needed between using floats, css flex and css grid.
The wireframes only acted as a guide and the final design was tweeked as content and media was added. 



Color Scheme
